# About Cycle.Express

Developers coming to Web3 have a steep entry barrier, because deploying smart contracts requires the acquisition of cryptocurrencies first.
Luckily new Web3 platforms like [Juno] try to lower this barrier, and one can get started immediately with the tools they are already familiar with (e.g. Javascript).
This is partly because [Juno] is subsidising the initial setup cost for the developers.

Now [Cycle.Express] goes one step further, a developer can keep their Apps running by topping up with just fiat money.
It means developing decentralized Web3 Apps no longer requires any cryptocurrency. How cool is that?!

## How does it work?

You pay at the current price of cycles per US dollar shown at the top of this website.
Just tell us the canister id of your Web3 App (called Satellite ID in [Juno]), we'll top it up by the amount you have paid for.

## What decides the cycle price per USD?

The price of a trillion cycles is pegged at the price of 1 [SDR], according to the [Internet Computer Protocol].
For example, 1 USD is about 0.75 SDR at the time of writing, which would translate to 0.75 trillion cycles.

Sometimes we were able to source cheaper cycles from the market, in which case some of the discount will be passed on to our users.

## How do I choose a different amount than the default $1.30? 

On Stripe's payment page, just choose "Change amount" below the dollar amount shown, and enter a new value that is between $1 and $100.

## Is the service legit?

Totally! Cycles are not a form of cryptocurrency, and we strongly believe that Web3 is not tied to cryptocurrencies either!
Cycle.Express lets you do just that, if you are also a believer of Web3 and decentralization.
